# Summary

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
Given sermons from church leaders in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, identify the author/speaker of the sermon/talk.  Topic (or in this case author) identification is a very popular and useful application of data science.

## BACKGROUND
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, on occasion, have the opportunity to give sermons, or talks based on various religious subjects associated with Jesus Christ.  There are leaders of the church who have the opportunity to speak to the worldwide general church membership twice a year in an event called General Conference.  In addition, these church leaders have opportunities to speak to the student body of one of the churchâ€™s universities, Brigham Young University in Provo, UT.

## DATA EXPLANATION
The corpora of sermons can be found at the speeches.byu.edu and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints General Conference websites.
