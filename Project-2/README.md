# Summary

This project consisted of a data visualization project of basketball shooting location from two of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan. 
In basketball and especially in the professional ranks, knowing the tendencies of a player is very important in determining strategy for the player that team is on, and the opposing team of that player.  Data is usually collected on players in what is called a scouting report.  A scouting report usually contains a shot chart, which is a graphical representation of where that player took shots on the basketball court and if those shots were made or missed.  For purposes of this project, we want to look at a couple of NBA players, Michael Jordan and Lebron James.  These two players are regarded as the best of their generation and arguably the best ever to play basketball.  This project will determine if there are certain areas on the court where these players are most likely to score from.
